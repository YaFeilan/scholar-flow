## 📖 Introduction

**ScholarFlow** is an intelligent academic platform designed to cover the entire research lifecycle. Powered by **Gemini**, it streamlines workflows from topic selection and data analysis to paper writing and submission.

The project is built with **TypeScript** for robust type safety and integrates advanced visualization tools (D3.js) and PDF export capabilities.

> * **🛑 Personal Use Only:** This program is intended for **personal use only**. It is **not open for commercial development** or business purposes.
> * **🧪 Beta Features:** The **Academic Search** and **PPT Generation** modules are currently in beta testing. Due to copyright restrictions, the search function may not retrieve full-text real-world literature. For presentations, we recommend using [Google NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google.com/) as a powerful alternative.
> * **🔍 Verification Required:** All text and data are generated by AI. Please strictly verify the accuracy of information and citations before use.
> * **🤖 Model Support:** This tool technically supports APIs for **Gemini, GPT, DeepSeek, and Doubao**. However, the current version has been fully tested and optimized **only for Gemini**.
